# Blue Nauta

Blue Nauta is a client app to make easy the process of logging in and logging out from the Nauta Captive Portal.

It aims to be multi platform. I created this tool because I change from Windows to Linux, and now I do not have a tool for logging in.

When I was a Windows user I used [this client](https://micuentanauta.github.io/).

The core of this app is the [nautapy package](https://github.com/atscub/nautapy), created by [ATS](https://github.com/atscub).
